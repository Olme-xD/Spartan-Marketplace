## About Me
I am a computer science student and would like to become a game developer and mobile app developer in the future. I enjoy tinkering with DIY electronics projects, mainly using ESP32 and Arduino ATmega chips. I am also interested in networks and implementing local services for my devices.

## My CSC340 Goals
In this class, I hope to learn how to create and implement industrial-grade software.
